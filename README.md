# Pair programming exercise
A public repo for the third sprint's hands-on exercise.

## Task requirements
- Ideally, have at least 3 pair-programming sessions with your peers;
- Out of the three sessions, at least 1 should be spent working on my problem and 1 should be spent working on the other person's problem;
- Try to dedicate at least an hour per session;
- Different tasks should be split and outlined as GitHub issues;
- Once the session starts, you should decide who goes and codes first;
- During the session, you should be only working either on your or your peer's problem.

## Game rules
This section outlines the main rules of the game and the losing conditions.

### Main rules
- The main objective of the game is to win all the cards;
- Card suits and values:
    - The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards;
    - Suits are ignored;
    - Values range from 2 to 14 (**A**ce);
- The card deck is divided between two players;
- Each player reveals the top card from their deck on the table. From here:
    - The player with a higher-ranking card wins the battle and takes all the cards;
- If both cards are of equal value, war commences. From here:
    - Both players take a card from the top of their deck and put it face-DOWN on the previously placed cards;
    - Both players take a card from the top of their deck and put it face-UP on the previously placed cards.
- The war continues until a higher-ranking card wins. The winner takes all of the cards.

### Losing condition
The player with no cards in their deck loses the game.

## Multi-player experience

The game might be played by three or four players as well in the following manner:

- Shuffle and deal out 17 cards for three players or 13 for four players;
- All players reveal their cards at the same time, just like the two-player version;
- If two or more players begin a war, ALL players participate in it;
- Just like the two-player version, the person with the highest-ranking card wins and takes all the cards;
- If a player has no more cards in their deck, they drop out.
